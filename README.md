
# Welcome to my GitHub profile
🌟I am a Graduate Student in Computer Science at the University of Central Missouri with a strong focus on cloud-based data engineering, machine learning workflows, and production-oriented AI systems. My work involves building scalable data pipelines, developing Python-based analytics and automation tools, and experimenting with cloud-native services.I have hands-on experience with AWS (SageMaker, Glue, Lambda, Redshift, S3) and exposure to GCP (BigQuery). My technical background includes Python, SQL, PySpark, FastAPI, and Power BI, with projects spanning ETL pipelines, feature engineering, API development, serverless automation, and ML experimentation.

This GitHub repository showcases my academic and hands-on projects, reflecting my continuous effort to strengthen my skills in cloud engineering, machine learning, and data-driven problem solving.

📚 Academic Projects
🔹 Customer Purchase Insights Dashboard

Built an end-to-end AWS-based data pipeline to process customer purchase data for analytics and reporting. The pipeline ingested raw data from Amazon S3, performed data transformation and validation using AWS Glue with PySpark, and loaded curated, structured datasets into PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS. Implemented Glue Crawlers and Glue ETL jobs to automate schema discovery and transformation workflows, ensuring analytics-ready data. The solution was designed to support business intelligence dashboards and data-driven insights, enabling efficient querying and reporting across structured datasets.L
